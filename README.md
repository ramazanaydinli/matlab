# matlab code created by ramazan aydinli
# the aim of this code is calculating pile capacity
# code takes different properties of multiple soil layers and calculates effective stress in the different depths in soils and gives visual output
# also the code calculates skin friction, tip resistance and ultimate capacity of a single pile by using the inputs
